# Progetto Drone
This project aims to develop a vision-based tracking system for a quadrotor UAV. The drone will be fixed to a test turret, with an onboard camera connected via USB to a PC. The PC will process the camera feed using OpenCV and Python, integrating YOLO v8 for real-time human detection. The processed video stream, including the YOLO-detected bounding boxes, will be displayed on the PC. A tracking algorithm, implemented in C++, will analyze the detected target's position and send movement commands to the drone's microcontroller (DY-FC-432) via CCS9. The goal is to ensure that the drone continuously adjusts its orientation to keep the target centered in the video feed.
